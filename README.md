# Introduction:
We would firstly like to acknowledge the effort of our judges for coming to our virtual hackathon at mnnit, hack36. After spending more than 50% of our college lives at home because of the Global pandemic, we thought why not find the solution to the problems of safely reopening colleges. We think that a place where maximum spread of the virus can take place is the hostel mess and hence, we have tried to make a mess management system. Basically, we make sure it doesnâ€™t get messy!!
